# weather_api_practice
This project started by reviewing content related to connecting to APIs and working with JSON data using Python. After cleaning and exploring some pulled data, the idea for a simple weather app was born. The app will display a national weather map using data from OpenWeatherMap API and Google Maps. It will eventually be uploaded to Heroku.

The project is currently in progress, with the initial data request and cleaning complete in the file named major_weather.ipynb. 

The next steps are to work with Google Maps to display a cleaner version of the map, and then display the app on Heroku.

Further steps are in the brainstorming phase. Thanks for reading!
